@ingroup modm_architecture
@defgroup modm_architecture_delay Blocking Delays

lbuild module: `modm:architecture:delay`

These functions allow you to spin for a short time using only the CPU.

In general it is recommended to use the `std::chrono` duration types to allow
the compiler to choose the optimal implementation for you:

~~~{.cpp}
#include <chrono>

constexpr std::chrono::nanoseconds DELAY_TIME{100};
modm::delay(DELAY_TIME);

constexpr std::chrono::microseconds DELAY_TIME2{200};
modm::delay(DELAY_TIME2); // same signature, different implementation
~~~

In your code you can also use the `std::chrono` literals:

~~~{.cpp}
using namespace std::chrono_literals;

modm::delay(100ns);
modm::delay(200us);
modm::delay(300ms);
~~~

In order to not require wild casting around of values, there are also three
overloads for (unsigned) integer values. These are particularly useful for when
you do not want to or cannot use chrono literals.

~~~{.cpp}
modm::delay_ns(100);
modm::delay_us(200);
modm::delay_ms(300);
~~~

Note that these delay functions work at any CPU clock speed, even if changed
dynamically at runtime and are available very early in the startup process at
hardware-init time.


## Limitations

The main limitations are accuracy and length of delay. The only guarantee given
to you is to delay for _at least_ the specified time. Note that invocation of
interrupts during spinning may add delay too. For additional limitations also
check the description of the `modm:platform:core` modules.

You should always prefer Software Timers (see `modm:processing:timer`) over
these *blocking* delay functions. However, when `modm::Clock` is not set up yet,
or when you need very small delays (for example to bit-bang a protocol), you
need to use these delay functions.
