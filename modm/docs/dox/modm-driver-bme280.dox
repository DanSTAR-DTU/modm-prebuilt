lbuild module: `modm:driver:bme280`

The BME280 is a high precision digital temperature, pressure and humidity
sensor with I2C interface.

It is known that many BME280-modules suffer from self-heating (I2C pull-ups?).
So the reported temperature is about 1 to 3 degree higher than with other sensors.
Forced ventilation can drop the temperature by 2 to 3 degrees.
